80:Chip: Here's your lunch, OK? Now, I put a dollar in there so you can buy some milk. You can ask one of the big kids where to do that. [He passes the lunch bag he is holding].
255:
256:Betsy: You remember your phone number? I wrote it down for you, just in case. Put it in your pocket, I don't want you to lose it. [She hands her a slip of paper]. Okay. You ready?

7672:
7685:
7686:Damian: It's gorgeous.
7709:
7727:
7824:
7825:Janis: This is Damian. He's almost too gay to function.
7881:
7940:
7941:Huge Guy: Nice wig, Janis. What's it made of?
7987:
8053:
8139:
8140:Damian: [Takes her schedule] "Health, Tuesday/Thursday, Room G-14."
8208:
8209:Janis: [Looks at Damian] I think that's in the back building.
8271:
8272:Damian: Yeah, that's in the back building.
8315:
8316:Janis: Yeah, we'll take you there.
8351:
8375:
8376:[The school bell rings and they walk down the hallway]
8431:
8641:
8667:
8668:Damian: Ew, why?
8685:
8732:
8733:Damian: That's beautiful. This girl is deep. [Janis and Damian sit down on the grass]
8819:
8869:
8870:Janis: It burned down in 1987.
8901:
8955:
8956:Janis: Why would we get you into trouble? We're your friends.
9018:
9262:
9263:Coach Carr: Don't have sex. Because you will get pregnant and die. Don't have sex in the missionary position, don't have sex standing up. Just don't do it, promise? Okay, everybody take some rubbers. (He holds up a box of condoms.)
9495:
9496:Janis: Why didn't they just keep home-schooling you?
9549:
9590:
9591:Damian: Oh, you'll get socialized, all right. A little slice like you.
9662:
9697:
9698:Janis: You're a regulation hottie.
9733:
9746:
9747:Damian: Own it.
9763:
9764:Janis: How do you spell your name again, Caddy?
9812:
9839:
9840:Janis: Yeah, I'm gonna call you Caddy.
9879:
9880:Damian: In the name of all that is holy, would you look at Karen Smith's gym clothes?
9966:
9967:Janis: Of course all The Plastics are in the same gym class.
10028:
10057:
10058:Damian: They're teen royalty. If North Shore was "Us Weekly" they would always be on the cover.
10154:
10155:Janis: That one there, that's Karen Smith. She is one of the dumbest girls you will ever meet. Damian sat next to her in English last year.
10295:
10296:Damian: She asked me how to spell "orange".
10340:
10341:Janis: And that little one? That's Gretchen Wieners.
10394:
10395:Damian: She's totally rich because her dad invented Toaster Strudel.
10464:
10465:Janis: Gretchen Wieners knows everybody's business. She knows everything about everyone.
10554:
10555:Damian: That's why her hair is so big. It's full of secrets.
10616:
10617:Janis: And evil takes a human form in Regina George. Don't be fooled, because she may seem like your typical selfish, back-stabbing, slut-faced hoe-bag. But in reality, she is so much more than that.
10817:
10818:Damian: She's the queen bee. The star. Those other two are just her little workers.
10902:
10903:Janis: Regina George. How do I even begin to explain Regina George?
10971:
10972:Emma Gerber: Regina George is flawless.
11012:
11013:Lea Edwards: She has two Fendi purses and a silver Lexus.
11071:
11072:Tim Pak: I hear her hair's insured for $10000.
11119:
11120:Amber D’Alessio: I hear she does car commercials.. in Japan.
11183:
11184:Kristen Hadley: Her favorite movie is Varsity blues.
11237:
11238:Giselle Sgro: One time, she met John Stamos on a plane.
11294:
11295:Jessica Lopez: And he told her she was pretty.
11342:
11343:Bethany Byrd: One time, she punched me in the face. It was awesome.
11411:
11412:Damian: She always looks fierce. She always wins Spring Fling Queen.
11481:
11482:Janis: Who cares?
11500:
11501:Damian: I care. Every year, the seniors throw this dance for the underclassmen called The Spring Fling. And whomsoever is elected Spring Fling King and Queen automatically becomes head of the Student Activities Committee. And since I am an active member of the Student Activities Committee, I would say, yeah, I care.
11819:
12332:
12333:Jason: Hey. We're doing a lunchtime survey of new students. Can you answer a few questions?
12425:
12436:
12437:Jason: Is your muffin buttered?
12469:
12482:
12483:Jason: Would you like us to assign someone to butter your muffin?
12549:
12565:
12566:Regina: Is he bothering you? Jason, why are you such a skeez?
12628:
12629:Jason: I'm just being friendly.
12661:
12662:Gretchen: You were supposed to call me last night.
12713:
12714:Regina: Jason, you do not come to a party at my house with Gretchen and then scam on some poor, innocent girl right in front of us three days later. She's not interested. Do you wanna have sex with him?
12917:
12939:
12940:Regina: Good. So it's settled. So you can go shave your back now. Bye, Jason.
13018:
13019:Jason: Bitch.
13033:
13034:Regina: Wait. Sit down. Seriously, sit down. Why don't I know you?
13101:
13148:
13149:Regina: What?
13163:
13198:
13199:Regina: Wait. What?
13219:
13254:
13255:Regina: No, no. I know what home-school is. I'm not retarded. So you've actually never been to a real school before? Shut up. Shut up.
13390:
13420:
13421:Regina: Home-schooled. That's really interesting.
13471:
13486:
13487:Regina: But you're, like, really pretty.
13528:
13546:
13547:Regina: So you agree?
13569:
13582:
13583:Regina: You think you're really pretty.
13623:
13650:
13651:Regina: Oh, my God, I love your bracelet. Where did you get it?
13715:
13749:
13750:Regina: It's adorable.
13773:
13774:Gretchen: Oh, it's so fetch.
13803:
13804:Regina: What is "fetch"?
13829:
13830:Gretchen: Oh, it's, like, slang. From England.
13877:
13878:Karen: So if you're from Africa, why are you white?
13930:
13931:Gretchen: Oh my God, Karen, you can't just ask people why they're white.
14004:
14005:Regina: Could you give us some privacy for, like, one second?
14067:
14086:
14087:Regina: OK, you should just know that we don't do this a lot, so this is, like, a really huge deal.
14187:
14188:Gretchen: We wanna invite you to have lunch with us every day for the rest of the week.
14276:
14298:
14299:Regina: Coolness. So we'll see you tomorrow.
14344:
14345:Karen: On Wednesdays, we wear pink.
14381:
14382:Janis: Oh, my God! OK, you have to do it, OK? And then you have to tell me all the horrible things that Regina says.
14499:
14526:
14527:Janis: Regina George is not sweet. She's a scum-sucking road whore! She ruined my life!
14615:
14616:Damian: She's fabulous, but she's evil.
14656:
14657:Short Girl: Hey, get out of here!
14691:
14692:Damian: Oh, my God, Danny DeVito. I love your work!
14744:
14772:
14773:Janis: What do you mean?
14798:
14842:
14843:Janis: Yes. What's your question?
14877:
14911:
14912:Damian: Regina started this rumor that Janis was...
14964:
14965:Janis: Damian! Shall we not? Now, look. This isn't about hating her, OK? I just think that it would be, like, a fun little experiment if you were to hang out with them and then tell us everything that they say.
15176:
15211:
15212:Janis: Hair products.
15234:
15235:Damian: Ashton Kutcher.
15259:
15282:
15283:Janis: Would you just do it? Please?
15320:
15364:
15365:Janis: No.
15376:
15377:Damian: Yes.
15390:
15542:
15543:Aaron: Hey, do you have a pencil I can borrow?
15590:
15750:
15787:
15809:
15870:
15871:Ms. Norbury: That's right. That's good. Very good. All right, let's talk about your homework.
15965:
15966:Chip: Hey. How was your second day?
16002:
16015:
16016:Betsy: Were people nice?
16041:
16052:
16053:Chip: Did you make any friends?
16085:
16098:
16237:
16238:Gretchen: You can't wear a tank top two days in a row, and you can only wear your Hair in a ponytail once a week. So I guess you picked today. Oh, and we only wear jeans or track pants on Fridays. Now, if you break any of these rules, you can't sit with us at lunch. I mean, not just you. Like, any of us. OK, like, if I was wearing jeans today, I would be sitting over there with the art freaks. Oh, and we always vote before we ask someone to eat lunch with us because you have to be considerate of the rest of the group. Well, I mean, you wouldn't buy a skirt without asking your friends first if it looks good on you.
16860:
16879:
16880:Gretchen: Right. Oh, and it's the same with guys. Like, you may think you like someone, but you could be wrong.
16992:
16993:Regina: 120 calories and 48 calories from fat. What percent is that?
17062:
17063:Gretchen: 48 into 120?
17086:
17087:Regina: I'm only eating foods with less than 30 percent calories from fat.
17162:
17263:
17264:Regina: Whatever. I'm getting cheese fries.
17308:
17309:Gretchen: So have you seen any guys that you think are cute yet?
17374:
17428:
17429:Karen: Who is it?
17447:
17448:Gretchen: It's a senior?
17473:
17506:
17507:Karen: No. No. No.
17526:
17527:Gretchen: No! Oh, no, you can't like Aaron Samuels. That's Regina's ex-boyfriend.
17609:
17610:Karen: They went out for a year.
17643:
17644:Gretchen: Yeah, and then she was devastated when he broke up with her last summer.
17727:
17728:Karen: I thought she dumped him for Shane Oman.
17776:
17777:Gretchen: OK, irregardless. Ex-boyfriends are just off-limits to friends. I mean, that's just, like, the rules of feminism. Don't worry. I'll never tell Regina what you said. It'll be our little secret.
17980:
17981:Ms. Norbury: We define the sum of the infinite geometric series...
18048:
18178:
18197:
18198:Kevin: Hey, you're the Africa girl, right?
18241:
18254:
18255:Kevin: I'm Kevin Gnapoor, captain of the North Shore Mathletes. We participate in math challenges against other high schools in the state, and we can get twice as much funding if we've got a girl. So you should think about joining.
18487:
18488:Ms. Norbury: Oh, you'd be perfect for it.
18530:
18555:
18556:Kevin: Great, great. Let me give you my card. OK, so think it over. Because we'd like to get jackets.
18658:
18669:
18670:Aaron: Hey!
18682:
18683:Regina: Get in, loser. We're going shopping.
18728:
18820:
18821:Karen: So how do you like North Shore?
18860:
18913:
18914:Regina: No! No, no.
18934:
18935:Gretchen: No, no.
18953:
18954:Regina: You cannot do that. That is social suicide. Damn, you are so lucky you have us to guide you.
19055:
19190:
19191:Gretchen: Oh, my God, there's Jason!
19228:
19229:Karen: Where? Oh, there he is.
19260:
19261:Gretchen: And he's with Taylor Wedell.
19300:
19301:Karen: I heard they're going out.
19335:
19336:Regina: Wait. Jason's not going out with Taylor. No. He cannot blow you off like that. He's such a little skeez. Give me your phone.
19469:
19470:Gretchen: You're not gonna call him, right?
19514:
19515:Regina: Do you think I'm an idiot?
19550:
19551:Gretchen: No. Uh-uh.
19572:
19573:Regina: Wedell on South Boulevard.
19608:
19609:Gretchen: Caller ID.
19630:
19631:Regina: Not when you connect from information.
19678:
19679:Mrs. Wedell: Hello?
19699:
19700:Regina: Hello. May I please speak to Taylor Wedell?
19752:
19753:Mrs. Wedell: She's not home yet. Who's calling?
19801:
19802:Regina: Oh, this is Susan from Planned Parenthood. I have her test results. If you can have her give me a call as soon as she can. It's urgent. Thank you. (She hangs up.) She's not going out with anyone.
20006:
20007:Gretchen: OK, that was so fetch.
20040:
20041:Taylor Wedell: Mom.
20061:
20100:
20101:Regina: I know, right?
20124:
20125:Gretchen: Make sure you check out her mom's boob job. They're hard as rocks.
20202:
20203:Regina: I'm home! Hey, Kylie.
20233:
20234:Kylie: Hey.
20246:
20247:June: Hey, hey, hey! How are my best girlfriends?
20297:
20340:
20341:June: Hello, sweetheart.
20366:
20377:
20378:June: Welcome to our home. Just want you to know, if you need anything, don't be shy, OK? There are no rules in this house. I'm not like a regular mom. I'm a cool mom. Right, Regina?
20561:
20562:Regina: Please stop talking.
20591:
20592:June: OK. I'm gonna make you girls a "hump day" treat.
20647:
20673:
20790:
20814:
20815:Regina: I love her. She's like a Martian.
20857:
20858:Karen: God, my hips are huge!
20888:
20889:Gretchen: Oh, please. I hate my calves.
20929:
20930:Regina: At least you guys can wear halters. I've got man shoulders.
20998:
21125:
21126:Gretchen: My hairline is so weird.
21161:
21162:Regina: My pores are huge.
21189:
21190:Karen: My nail beds suck.
21216:
21264:
21265:Karen: Ew.
21276:
21277:June: Hey, you guys. Happy hour is from 4 to 6!
21325:
21370:
21371:June: Oh, God, honey, no. What kind of mother do you think I am? Why? Do you want a bit? If you're gonna drink, I'd rather you do it in the house.
21518:
21540:
21541:June: OK. So, you guys, what is the 411? What has everybody been up to? What is the hot gossip? Tell me everything. What are you guys listening to? What's the cool jams?
21711:
21712:Regina: Mom. Could you go fix your hair?
21753:
21754:June: OK. You girls keep me young. Oh, I love you so much.
21813:
21814:Karen: Oh, my God, I remember this.
21850:
21851:Regina: I haven't looked at that in forever.
21896:
22031:
22032:Karen: (She's reading.) "Trang Pak is a grotsky little byotch."
22096:
22097:Regina: Still true.
22117:
22118:Gretchen: (She's reading.) "Dawn Schweitzer is a fat virgin."
22180:
22181:Regina: Still half true.
22206:
22207:Karen: (She's reading.) "Amber D'Alessio." She made out with a hot dog.
22279:
22280:Gretchen: (She's reading.) "Janis Ian, dyke."
22326:
22327:Karen: Who is that?
22347:
22348:Gretchen: I think that's that kid Damian.
22390:
22436:
22437:Regina: That's funny. Put that in there.
22478:
22541:
22640:
22641:Janis: What does it say about me?
22675:
22715:
22716:Janis: Those bitches.
22738:
22739:Damian: Will this minimize my pores?
22776:
22777:Janis: No. Caddy, you gotta steal that book.
22822:
22837:
22838:Janis: Oh, come on. We could publish it, and then everybody would see what an ax-wound she really is.
22940:
22962:
23153:
23154:Damian: Does that mean I'm morally obligated to burn that lady's outfit? Oh, my God, that's Ms. Norbury.
23259:
23260:Janis: I love seeing teachers outside of school. It's like seeing a dog walk on its hind legs.
23355:
23356:Ms. Norbury: Hey, guys, what's up? I didn't know you worked here.
23422:
23423:Janis: Yeah, moderately priced soaps are my calling.
23476:
23477:Damian: You shopping?
23499:
23500:Ms. Norbury: No, I'm just here with my boyfriend. Joking. Sometimes older people make jokes.
23593:
23594:Damian: My nana takes her wig off when she's drunk.
23646:
23964:
23996:
23997:Ms. Norbury: Great.
24017:
24018:Damian: You can't join Mathletes. It's social suicide.
24073:
24074:Ms. Norbury: Thanks, Damian. Well, this has been sufficiently awkward. And I'll see you guys tomorrow.
24177:
24189:
24190:Ms. Norbury: Bye.
24208:
24209:Janis: Oh, man, that is bleak. So when are you gonna see Regina again?
24280:
24327:
24328:Janis: Come on, she's never gonna find out. It'll be like our little secret.
24405:
24406:(The phone rings.)
24425:
24439:
24440:Regina: I know your secret.
24468:
24550:
24592:
24593:Regina: Gretchen told me that you like Aaron Samuels. I mean, I don't care, do whatever you want. But let me just tell you something about Aaron. All he cares about is school and his mom and his friends.
24797:
24817:
24818:Regina: But if you like him... Whatever. I mean, I could talk to him for you if you want.
24908:
24987:
24988:Regina: Oh, no, trust me. I know exactly how to play it. But wait. Aren't you so mad at Gretchen for telling me?
25101:
25112:
25113:Regina: Because if you are, you can tell me. It was a really bitchy thing for her to do.
25202:
25300:
25301:Regina: See, Gretch? I told you she's not mad at you.
25355:
25356:Gretchen: I can't believe you think I like attention!
25410:
25475:
25476:(She hangs up.)
25492:
25669:
25694:
25739:
25740:Aaron: It's raining.
25761:
25774:
25850:
25897:
25928:
25929:Aaron: Yeah.
25942:
26005:
26006:Aaron: It's a factorial, so you multiply each one by N.
26062:
26081:
26111:
26112:Aaron: Yeah, they're the same thing.
26149:
26185:
26218:
26219:Ms. Norbury: Lights, please. OK. See you guys tomorrow.
26275:
26276:Aaron: We're having a Halloween party at my friend Chris' tonight. You wanna come?
26359:
26378:
26379:Aaron: Great. Here's where it is. It's a costume party. People get pretty into it.
26462:
26473:
26474:Aaron: That flyer admits one person only, so don't bring some other guy with you.
26556:
26627:
26628:Aaron: Right. Well... grool. See you tonight.
26674:
26675:Kevin: Hey, Africa. You staying for the Mathletes meeting?
26734:
26767:
27129:
27130:June: Doesn't she look great, honey?
27167:
27168:Karen: Ha!
27179:
27180:Gretchen: What are you?
27204:
27205:Karen: I'm a mouse. Duh.
27230:
27319:
27331:
27332:Guy: Yes! Yes!
27347:
27359:
27360:Karen: Why are you dressed so scary?
27397:
27420:
27421:Gretchen: Have you seen Jason?
27452:
27453:Karen: You know who's looking fine tonight? Seth Mosakowski.
27514:
27515:Gretchen: OK, you did not just say that.
27556:
27557:Karen: What? He's a good kisser.
27590:
27591:Gretchen: He's your cousin.
27619:
27620:Karen: Yeah, but he's my first cousin.
27659:
27660:Gretchen: Right.
27677:
27678:Karen: So you have your cousins and then you have your first cousins, then you have your second cousins.
27783:
27784:Gretchen: No, honey.
27805:
27806:Karen: That's not right, is it?
27838:
27839:Gretchen: That is so not right.
27871:
27872:Aaron: Hey!
27884:
27896:
27897:Aaron: You made it. And you are... a zombie bride.
27948:
27969:
27970:Aaron: Love it. Can I get you something to drink?
28020:
28033:
28034:Aaron: Be right back.
28056:
28071:
28072:Gretchen: Karen, stop it. Don't, Karen...
28114:
28115:Karen: Hey, Seth!
28133:
28134:Regina: Hey.
28147:
28148:Aaron: Oh, no. Didn't anybody tell you? You were supposed to wear a costume.
28225:
28291:
28292:Aaron: Yeah, she's cool. I invited her tonight.
28340:
28341:Regina: Well, be careful because she has a huge crush on you.
28403:
28404:Aaron: Really? How do you know?
28436:
28437:Regina: Because she told me. She tells everybody. It's kind of cute, actually. She's like a little girl. She, like, writes all over her notebook, "Mrs. Aaron Samuels." And she made this T-shirt that says "I heart Aaron" and she wears it under all her clothes.
28697:
28698:Aaron: Oh, come on.
28718:
28719:Regina: Well, who can blame her? I mean, you're gorgeous. And OK, look, I'm not saying she's a stalker, but she saved this Kleenex you used and she said she's gonna do some kind of African voodoo with it to make you like her.
28945:
28946:Aaron: What?
28959:
29045:
29046:Regina: I know she's kind of socially retarded and weird, but she's my friend, so just promise me you won't make fun of her.
29171:
29172:Aaron: Of course I'm not gonna make fun of her.
29220:
29289:
29290:Aaron: What are you doing? You broke up with me.
29339:
29340:Regina: That's crazy. Why would I break up with you? You're so hot.
29408:
29409:Shane: That's a scary mask, bro.
29442:
29682:
29732:
29733:Janis: Oh, no, Caddy.
29755:
29785:
29786:Janis: Because she's a life-ruiner. She ruins people's lives.
29848:
29849:Damian: When we were 13 she made people sign this petition saying that Janis was...
29933:
29934:Janis: Damian! Please! Look, she's not gonna get away with this again, OK? We're gonna do something.
30035:
30050:
30051:Janis: Regina George is an evil dictator. Now, how do you overthrow a dictator? You cut off her resources. Regina would be nothing without her high-status man candy, technically good physique, and ignorant band of loyal followers. Now, Caddy, if we want this to work, you are gonna have to keep hanging out with them like nothing is wrong. Can you do it?
30406:
30426:
30427:Janis: OK, let's rock this bitch.
30461:
30543:
30544:Gretchen: And Regina wanted me to tell you that she was trying to hook you up with Aaron, but he was just interested in getting her back. And that's not Regina's fault.
30713:
30732:
30733:Gretchen: OK, so you're not mad at Regina?
30776:
30792:
30793:Gretchen: Oh, OK, good. Because Regina wanted me to give you this.
30860:
30861:Regina: It's called the South Beach Fat Flush, and all you drink is cranberry juice for 72 hours.
30959:
30960:Aaron: This isn't even cranberry juice. It's cranberry juice cocktail. It's all sugar.
31047:
31048:Regina: I wanna lose 3 pounds.
31079:
31080:Aaron: You're crazy.
31101:
31247:
31391:
31432:
31498:
31499:Regina: All this cranberry juice is making me break out.
31556:
31620:
31621:Regina: OK.
31633:
31699:
31727:
31728:Regina: Thank you. (to Aaron) Hey.
31763:
31764:Aaron: Hey. Your face smells like peppermint.
31810:
31811:Janis: This is ass, you guys. It's been a month, and all we've done is make Regina's face smell like a foot.
31920:
31921:Damian: I've been really busy with choir.
31963:
31964:Janis: We gotta crack Gretchen Wieners. We crack Gretchen, and then we crack the lock on Regina's whole dirty history.
32083:
32084:Damian: Say "crack" again.
32111:
32112:Janis: Crack. All right, let's reconvene tonight.
32162:
32272:
32273:Janis and Damian: "Jingle Bell Rock."
32311:
32343:
32344:Janis: Everybody in the English-speaking world knows that song.
32408:
32409:Damian: They do it every year.
32440:
32494:
32495:Regina: Why were you talking to Janis Ian?
32538:
32656:
32657:Regina: She's so pathetic. Let me tell you something about Janis Ian. We were best friends in middle school. I know, right? It's so embarrassing. I don't even... Whatever. So then in eighth grade, I started going out with my first boyfriend, Kyle, who was totally gorgeous, but then he moved to Indiana. And Janis was, like, weirdly jealous of him. Like, if I would blow her off to hang out with Kyle, she'd be like, "Why didn't you call me back?" And I'd be like, "Why are you so obsessed with me?" So then, for my birthday party, which was an all-girls pool party, I was like, "Janis, I can't invite you, because I think you're a lesbian." I mean, I couldn't have a lesbian at my party. There are gonna be girls there in their bathing suits. I mean, right? She was a lesbian. So then her mom called my mom and started yelling at her. It was so retarded. And then she dropped out of school because no one would talk to her. When she came back in the fall for high school, all of her hair was cut off and she was totally weird, and now I guess she's on crack. (to Lea Edwards) Oh, my God! I love your skirt. Where did you get it?
33787:
33788:Lea Edwards: It was my mom's in the 80's.
33830:
33831:Regina: Vintage. So adorable.
33861:
33862:Lea Edwards: Thanks.
33883:
33950:
33951:Regina: (in a flashback) Oh, my God, I love your bracelet. Where did you get it?
34032:
34078:
34079:Regina: No. I don't send them, I just get them. So you better send me one, byotch. Love you.
34172:
34279:
34301:
34302:English Teacher: "Why, Man, he doth bestride the narrow world like a colossus" might translate into "Why is he so huge and obnoxious?"
34437:
34438:Damian: (dressed as Santa) Ho, ho, ho, ho! Candy cane-grams!
34499:
34500:English Teacher: OK, hurry up.
34531:
34532:Damian: (dressed as Santa) Taylor Zimmerman? Two for you. Glenn Coco? Four for you, Glenn Coco. You go, Glenn Coco. And Caddy Heron. Do we have a Caddy Heron here?
34696:
34714:
34814:
34815:Gretchen: Who's that from?
34842:
34930:
34931:English Teacher: OK, back to Caesar.
34968:
35105:
35319:
35320:Damian: (to Ms. Norbury) Don't look at me. (singing) Every day is so wonderful.
35400:
35401:Gretchen: I mean, why would Regina send you guys candy canes and not me?
35474:
35475:Karen: Maybe she forgot about you.
35510:
35604:
35605:Gretchen: Well, I mean, her parents totally don't sleep in the same bed anymore, if that's what you mean. Oh, my God. Don't tell her I told you that.
35755:
35756:Damian: (singing) I am beautiful in every single way. Yes, words can't bring me down. Don't you bring me down today.
35873:
35874:Gretchen: I mean, no offense, but why would she send you a candy cane? She doesn't even like you that much. Maybe she feels weird around me because I'm the only person that knows about her nose job. Oh, my God. Pretend you didn't hear that.
36115:
36116:Kevin: (rapping.) Yo, yo, yo. All you sucker Mcs ain't got nothing on me. From my grades to my lines, you can't touch Kevin G. I'm a Mathlete. So nerd is inferred but forget what you heard. I'm like James Bond the Third. Shaken not stirred, I'm Kevin Gnapoor. The G is silent when I sneak in your door. And make love to your woman on the bathroom floor. I don't play it like Shaggy, you'll know it was me. Because the next time you see her, she'll be like "Oh, Kevin G"!
36587:
36633:
36634:Kevin: Happy holidays, everybody.
36668:
36732:
36733:Damian: Does it bother you that they still use your original choreography?
36808:
36809:Janis: Shut up.
36825:
36826:Kevin: Damn.
36839:
36840:Janis: What?
36853:
36854:Kevin: I'd rather see you out there shaking that thing.
36910:
36953:
36954:Gretchen: But I'm always on your left.
36993:
36994:Regina: Well, that was when there were three of us, and now the tallest go in the middle.
37084:
37085:Gretchen: But the whole dance will be backwards. I'm always on your left.
37159:
37160:Regina: And right now you're getting on my last nerve. Switch.
37223:
37320:
37321:(Song): Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock. Jingle bells swing and jingle bells ring. Snowing and blowing up bushels of fun. Now the jingle hop has begun. Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock. Jingle bells chime in jingle bell time. Dancing and prancing in jingle bell square. In the fr...
37625:
37626:Gretchen: Jason?
37643:
37644:Everyone: (singing) What a bright time. It's the right time to rock the night away. Jingle bell time is a swell time to go riding in a one-horse sleigh. Giddy-up, jingle horse. Pick up your feet. Jingle around the clock. Mix and mingle in a jingling beat. That's the jingle bell, That's the jingle bell, that’s the jingle bell rock.
37979:
37980:Karen: That was the best it ever went!
38019:
38020:Aaron: That was awesome.
38045:
38046:Regina: Uh, lip gloss.
38069:
38070:Kevin: Hey, good job, Africa.
38100:
38115:
38193:
38213:
38214:Gretchen: That's why you wanted to join the Mathletes.
38269:
38270:Aaron: Mathletes? You hate math.
38303:
38304:Gretchen: Look how red she is. You love him. And he totally complimented you. That is so fetch.
38400:
38401:Regina: Gretchen, stop trying to make "fetch" happen. It's not going to happen.
38481:
38482:Gretchen: “Why should Caesar get to stomp around like a giant while the rest of us try not to get smushed under his big feet? What's so great about Caesar? Brutus is just as cute as Caesar. OK, Brutus is just as smart as Caesar. People totally like Brutus just as much as they like Caesar. And when did it become OK for one person to be the boss of everybody? Because that's not what Rome is about! We should totally just stab Caesar!”
38922:
38964:
38965:Gretchen: OK, if you even knew how mean she really is.You know that I'm not allowed to wear hoop earrings, right? Yeah. Two years ago, she told me that hoop earrings were her thing and that I wasn't allowed to wear them anymore. And then for Hanukkah, my parents got me this pair of really expensive white-gold hoops. And I had to pretend like I didn't even like them, and it was so sad. And you know she cheats on Aaron? Yes. Every Thursday he thinks she's doing SAT prep. But really, she's hooking up with Shane Oman in the projection room above the auditorium, and I never told anybody that, because I'm such a good friend. (cries)
39600:
39758:
39770:
39771:Aaron: Hey, what's up?
39794:
39880:
39881:Aaron: Coach Carr?
39900:
39901:Coach Carr: Huh?
39918:
39919:Damian: Trang Pak?
39938:
40002:
40003:Janis: No, we just have to regroup. Think outside our box.
40062:
40063:Damian: What are Kälteen bars?
40095:
40316:
40317:Regina: Give me it. It's all in, like, Swedish or something.
40378:
40473:
40474:Regina: Ephedrine?
40493:
40504:
40505:Regina: Phentermine.
40526:
40586:
40587:Regina: I really wanna lose 3 pounds.
40625:
40626:Gretchen: Oh, my God, what are you talking about?
40676:
40677:Karen: You're so skinny.
40702:
40703:Regina: Shut up.
40720:
40858:
40859:Regina: OK. You have really good eyebrows.
40902:
40917:
40918:Regina: (to Gretchen) Move.
40946:
41267:
41268:Short Girl: That new girl moved here from Africa.
41318:
41424:
41500:
41665:
41877:
41944:
41945:Janis: I don't know. Now that's she's getting fatter, she's got pretty big jugs.
42026:
42142:
42233:
42234:Janis: Yeah, I know. You told me that one before. Hey, I'm having an art show. So why don't you take a night off from your double life. I want you to see it.
42392:
42409:
42410:Janis: What is that smell?
42437:
42477:
42478:Janis: You smell like a baby prostitute.
42519:
42534:
42608:
42657:
42687:
42688:Aaron: Kind of seems like you get it.
42726:
42805:
42806:Ms. Norbury: Not your best.
42834:
42835:Kevin: Damn, Africa, what happened?
42871:
42872:Aaron: How'd you do?
42893:
42947:
42948:Aaron: I'll tutor you, if you ever wanna get together after school or something.
43029:
43068:
43069:Aaron: No. You guys are friends. Well, maybe we just won't tell her.
43138:
43180:
43181:Aaron: Well, the first time I did it, I got a zero.
43233:
43252:
43253:Aaron: But then when I checked it, I got...one.
43301:
43327:
43349:
43350:Aaron: Yeah, you have to check it because sometimes the product of two negative integers is a positive number.
43461:
43511:
43512:Aaron: That's right. That's good.
43546:
43580:
43581:Aaron: Man, um, look, I...I can't do this. It's not fair to Regina.
43649:
43677:
43678:Aaron: Look, I know she can be really mean sometimes, but...
43739:
43772:
43773:Aaron: Why do you?
43792:
43804:
43805:Aaron: Look, there's good and bad in everybody. Right? Regina's just…She's just more upfront about it.
43910:
43996:
44026:
44027:Aaron: What?
44040:
44041:Karen: Did he say why?
44064:
44065:Regina: Somebody told him about Shane Oman.
44109:
44110:Gretchen: Who?
44125:
44126:Regina: He said some guy on the baseball team.
44173:
44174:Karen: Baseball team?
44196:
44197:Regina: I gave him everything. I was half a virgin when I met him.
44264:
44265:Karen: You wanna do something fun? You wanna go to Taco Bell?
44327:
44328:Regina: I can't go to Taco Bell, I'm on an all-carb diet. God, Karen, you are so stupid!
44417:
44418:Gretchen: Regina, wait. Talk to me.
44454:
44455:Regina: Nobody understands me.
44486:
44487:Gretchen: I understand you.
44515:
44548:
44549:Karen: No. I am, actually. I'm failing almost everything.
44607:
44660:
44661:Karen: I can put my whole fist in my mouth. Wanna see?
44716:
44753:
44754:Karen: I'm kind of psychic. I have a fifth sense.
44804:
44829:
44830:Karen: It's like I have ESPN or something. My breasts can always tell when it's gonna rain.
44922:
44953:
44954:Karen: Well, they can tell when it's raining.
45000:
45190:
45191:June: Do you guys need anything? Some snacks? A condom? Let me know. Oh, God love you.
45278:
45469:
45470:Announcements Teacher: And finally, the nominees for Spring Fling Queen are as follows: Regina George. Gretchen Wieners. Janis Ian.
45602:
45603:Regina: What is happening to the world?
45643:
45644:Announcements Teacher: And the final nominee for Spring Fling Queen…
45715:
45716:Damian: I couldn't help myself. It was so easy.
45764:
45806:
45875:
45876:Damian: I didn't put you in there.
45911:
45949:
46117:
46118:Regina: Can someone zip me up?
46149:
46150:Karen: It won't close.
46173:
46174:Regina: It's a 5.
46192:
46193:Gretchen: OK, it must be marked wrong.
46232:
46304:
46619:
46620:Regina: You know Swedish?
46646:
46696:
46697:Karen: Ma'am, do you have this in the next size up?
46749:
46750:Salesperson: Sorry. We only carry sizes 1, 3, and 5. You could try Sears.
46824:
46825:Regina: Ugh.
46838:
46925:
46941:
47065:
47080:
47268:
47300:
47301:Ms. Norbury: I know, How would I know right? I'm divorced. I'm broke from getting divorced. The only guy that ever calls my house is Randy from Chase Visa. And you know why? Because I'm a pusher. I push people. I pushed my husband into law school. That was a bust. I pushed myself into working three jobs. And now I'm gonna push you because I know you're smarter than this.
47675:
47774:
47775:Ms. Norbury: Oh, I will.
47800:
47977:
47978:Regina: What does that even mean?
48012:
48013:Gretchen: Like a drug pusher?
48043:
48168:
48169:Gretchen: You let it out, honey. Put it in the book.
48222:
48329:
48330:Janis: Hey, I called you last night. How come you didn't call me back?
48401:
48431:
48432:Janis: So you need a ride to my art show this weekend?
48487:
48553:
48554:Damian: Well, you wanna watch a movie tonight?
48601:
48657:
48658:Janis: But we don't have anything planned for tonight.
48713:
48902:
48903:Regina: Oh, my God, I'm not mad at her. I'm worried about her. I think somebody nominated her as a joke or something. And when nobody votes for her, she's gonna have a total meltdown. And who's gonna have to take care of her? Me.
49133:
49185:
49458:
49508:
49509:Gretchen: Hold on.
49528:
49547:
49548:Gretchen: Shh!
49563:
49564:(phone rings.)
49579:
49580:Karen: Hello?
49594:
49595:Gretchen: If someone said something bad about you, you'd want me to tell you, right?
49680:
49681:Karen: No.
49692:
49693:Gretchen: What if it was someone you thought was your friend?
49755:
49756:Karen: What are you...? Hold on. Other line.
49801:
49852:
49881:
49882:Karen: (to Regina.) Hello?
49909:
49910:Regina: Let's go out.
49932:
49933:Karen: OK. Hold on. I'm on the other line with Gretchen.
49990:
49991:Regina: Don't invite Gretchen. She's driving me nuts.
50045:
50046:Karen: Hold on.
50062:
50063:Regina: OK, hurry up.
50085:
50086:Karen: (to Gretchen.) It's Regina. She wants to hang out with me tonight, but she told me not to tell you.
50193:
50194:Gretchen: Do not hang out with her.
50230:
50231:Karen: Why?
50243:
50244:Gretchen: You don't want me to tell you.
50285:
50286:Karen: (to Gretchen.) Ugh, You can tell me. Hold on. (to Regina.) Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
50383:
50384:Gretchen: Who is?
50402:
50403:Karen: Who's this?
50422:
50423:Gretchen: Gretchen.
50443:
50444:Karen: (to Gretchen.) Right. Hold on. (to Regina.) Oh, my God, she's so annoying.
50526:
50527:Regina: I know. Just get rid of her.
50564:
50565:Karen: (to Gretchen.) OK. What is it?
50603:
50604:Gretchen: Regina says everyone hates you because you're such a slut.
50673:
50674:Karen: She said that?
50696:
50697:Gretchen: You didn't hear it from me.
50735:
50764:
50821:
50822:Karen: (to Regina.) I can't go out. (She fake coughs.) I'm sick.
50887:
50888:Regina: Boo. You whore.
50912:
50913:(hangs up.)
50925:
50926:Gretchen: Regina, we have to talk to you.
50968:
50969:Regina: Is butter a carb?
50995:
51007:
51008:Gretchen: Regina, you're wearing sweatpants. It's Monday.
51066:
51067:Regina: So?
51079:
51080:Karen: So that's against the rules and you can't sit with us.
51142:
51143:Regina: Whatever. Those rules aren't real.
51186:
51187:Karen: They were real that day I wore a vest.
51233:
51234:Regina: Because that vest was disgusting.
51276:
51277:Gretchen: You can't sit with us!
51310:
51311:Regina: These sweatpants are all that fits me right now. (After a short pause.) Fine. You can walk home, bitches.
51425:
51426:Emma Gerber: Watch where you're going, fat-ass!
51474:
51475:(Everyone laughs.)
51494:
51559:
51560:Gretchen: So, what are we doing this weekend?
51606:
51607:Karen: Yeah, what are we doing?
51639:
51691:
51692:Karen: What...?
51708:
51747:
51748:Karen: What?
51761:
51762:Gretchen: What?
51778:
51815:
51851:
51852:Gretchen: Yeah.
51868:
51869:Karen: Yeah. Yeah.
51888:
51967:
51968:Betsy: We've had these tickets for months. You love Ladysmith Black Mambazo.
52045:
52099:
52163:
52224:
52296:
52297:Aaron: Is Regina going?
52321:
52440:
52441:Aaron: Fine, I'll go.
52463:
52505:
52506:Betsy: Bye!
52518:
52697:
52715:
52716:Gretchen and Karen: You look awesome!
52754:
52862:
52863:Karen: Yeah.
52876:
52877:Gretchen: Yeah. Oh, yeah.
52903:
52914:
53007:
53008:Gretchen: Jason is here with Taylor Wedell.
53052:
53053:Karen: He's just using her to make you mad.
53097:
53134:
53135:Karen: No.
53146:
53147:Jason: Dude, put on "The Ramayana Monkey Chant".
53196:
53218:
53219:Huge Guy: Deek! What up, dog?
53249:
53250:Regina: She thinks she's gonna have a party and not invite me? Who does she think she is?
53340:
53341:Shane: You're right, hon.
53367:
53368:Regina: I, like, invented her, you know what I mean?
53421:
53422:Gretchen: Jason, I have to talk to you. Whoa!
53468:
53469:Taylor Wedell: Whatever.
53494:
53495:Gretchen: I love you.
53517:
53518:Jason: I know, I know.
53541:
53568:
53606:
53607:Kevin: What's up? Gretchen came to talk to me.
53654:
53674:
53675:Kevin: Look, I don't wanna hurt your feelings, but I only date women of color.
53754:
53824:
53825:Aaron: Hey.
53837:
53849:
53850:Aaron: I've been looking for you everywhere.
53895:
53910:
53911:Aaron: Wow. You look…New clothes?
53947:
53962:
53963:Aaron: You wanna go downstairs?
53995:
54027:
54028:Aaron: Thanks for getting me to come out tonight.
54078:
54109:
54110:Aaron: I wasted too much time being pissed off at Regina. No more liars.
54183:
54216:
54217:Aaron: I know, I know.
54240:
54356:
54357:Aaron: Tell me what?
54378:
54590:
54591:Aaron: Wait. You're failing on purpose? That's stupid.
54646:
54729:
54730:Aaron: So why didn't you just talk to me?
54772:
54857:
54858:Aaron: Her property?
54879:
54919:
54920:Aaron: No, don't tell me to shut up.
54957:
54976:
54977:Aaron: God, you know what? You are just like a clone of Regina.
55041:
55104:
55181:
55182:Regina: What is this?!
55205:
55231:
55250:
55251:Aaron: Eww.
55263:
55332:
55333:Janis: You dirty little liar.
55363:
55396:
55397:Janis: Explain how you forgot to invite us to your party?
55455:
55456:Damian: Janis, I cannot stop this car. I have a curfew.
55512:
55583:
55584:Janis: Hey, buddy, you're not pretending anymore. You're Plastic. Cold, shiny, hard Plastic.
55677:
55678:Damian: Curfew, 1 a.m. It is now 1:10.
55717:
55718:Janis: Did you have an awesome time? Did you drink awesome shooters and listen to awesome music, and then just sit around and soak up each other's awesomeness?
55878:
55973:
55974:Janis: God! See, at least me and Regina George know we're mean. You try to act like you're so innocent. Like, "Oh, I used to live in Africa with all the little birdies and the little monkeys.”
56169:
56246:
56247:Janis: What?!
56261:
56262:Damian: Oh, no she did not!
56290:
56675:
56676:Damian: And I want my pink shirt back! I want my pink shirt back!
56742:
56743:Shane: Hon, slow down.
56766:
56767:Regina: It's like I can't trust anyone anymore.
56815:
56816:Shane: Why are you eating a Kälteen bar?
56858:
56859:Regina: I'm starving.
56881:
56882:Shane: Man, I hate those things. Coach Carr makes us eat those when we wanna move up a weight class.
56983:
56984:Regina: What?
56998:
56999:Shane: They make you gain weight like crazy.
57044:
57282:
57400:
57401:Regina: “Fat whore”. (cries)
57434:
57475:
57476:Regina: (cries) Why would someone write that? That's just so mean.
57543:
57602:
57603:Regina: (She cries.) There's only three girls in the whole school who aren't in it.
57687:
57688:Coach Carr: At your age, you're gonna be having a lot of urges. You're gonna want to take off your clothes and touch each other. But if you do touch each other, you will get chlamydia. And die.
57882:
57883:Student: Coach Carr.
57904:
58006:
58040:
58064:
58134:
58198:
58296:
58297:Gretchen: It's not ours, it's Regina's. Yeah, she's trying to make it look like we wrote it, but really, she wrote it.
58416:
58604:
58605:Gretchen: Maybe we're not in that book, because everybody likes us. And I don't wanna be punished for being well-liked. And I don't think my father, the inventor of Toaster Strudel, would be too pleased to hear about this.
58828:
58829:Amber D’Alessio: (reading) "Made out with a hot dog"? Oh, my God, that was one time!
58916:
58917:Dawn Schweitzer: (reading) "Dawn Schweitzer has a huge ass"? Who would write that?
59000:
59001:Kristen Hadley: Who wouldn't write that?
59042:
59043:Jason: (reading) "Trang Pak made out with Coach Carr"? And so did Sun Jin Dinh.
59123:
59124:Trang Pak: (speaking Vietnamese) You little slut!
59174:
59175:Sun Jin Dinh: (speaking Vietnamese) You’re the slut!
59230:
59231:Ms. Norbury: Hey! Hey! Settle down! All right, hey. No. You do not push and shove--Ow!
59318:
59372:
59373:Gretchen: No, I can't answer any more questions until I have a parent or lawyer present.
59462:
59487:
59488:Karen: Whoever wrote it probably didn't think anyone would ever see it?
59560:
59615:
59616:Kristen Hadley’s boyfriend: Mom, can you pick me up? I'm scared.
59683:
59684:Damian: (reading) "Janis Ian, dyke"?
59721:
59722:Janis: That's original.
59746:
59747:Damian: (reading) "Too gay to function"?!
59789:
59790:Janis: Hey! That's only OK when I say it.
59832:
59833:Jessica Lopez: Did you write this?
59868:
59869:Giselle Sgro: No, I swear!
59896:
59897:Bethany Byrd: Then you told somebody!
59935:
59936:Kristen Hadley: She told!
59962:
59963:Skater Girl 1: You little bitch!
59996:
59997:Skater Girl 2: You're a bitch!
60028:
60029:Jason: Yeah! Take your top off!
60061:
60109:
60110:Announcements Teacher: Ron, come quick! They've gone wild. The girls have gone wild.
60195:
60266:
60267:Coach Carr: Hey, I pulled these two off each other.
60319:
60463:
60464:Lea Edwards: Oh, crap! My hair!
60496:
60576:
60724:
60930:
60931:Everyone: No!
60945:
60946:Gretchen: No.
60960:
60961:Karen: What are we supposed to do?
60996:
61383:
61384:Announcements Teacher: We can't keep them past 4.
61434:
61644:
61645:Bethany Byrd: Somebody wrote in that book that I'm lying about being a virgin because I use super-jumbo tampons. But I can't help it if I've got a heavy flow and a wide-set vagina.
61826:
61933:
61934:Ms. Norbury: I am?
61953:
62074:
62075:Ms. Norbury: It's not a self-esteem problem. I think they're all pretty pleased with themselves. OK. OK, uh. Everybody close your eyes. I want you to raise your hand if you have ever had a girl say something bad about you behind your back. Open your eyes. Now, close your eyes again. And this time, I want you to raise your hand if you have ever said anything about a friend behind her back. Open them. There's been some girl-on-girl crime here. OK. So, what we could do today is a couple exercises to help you express your anger in a healthy way. Let's start over here.
62646:
62801:
62802:Kristen Hadley: You've been acting really stuck-up ever since you switched to shortfielder. And Dawn agrees with me.
62919:
62920:Jock Girl: Dawn?
62937:
62938:Dawn Schweitzer: Don't drag me into this, I'm pitching tomorrow.
63003:
63004:Trang Pak: (speaking Vietnamese) Why are you scamming on my boyfriend?
63075:
63076:Sun Jin Dinh: (speaking Vietnamese) You’re just jealous because guys like me better.
63163:
63164:Trang Pak: (speaking Vietnamese) Nigga please.
63211:
63212:Ms. Norbury: OK. Good.
63235:
63236:Regina: Can I just say that we don't have a clique problem at this school? And some of us shouldn't have to take this workshop, because some of us are just victims in this situation.
63419:
63608:
63625:
63644:
63645:Ms. Norbury: You never made up a rumor about anybody?
63699:
63737:
63756:
63757:Ms. Norbury: Nothing you want to apologize for?
63805:
63901:
63920:
64244:
64334:
64335:Michigan Girl: Alyssa, I'm sorry I called you a gap-toothed bitch. It's not your fault you're so gap-toothed.
64445:
64446:Karen: Gretchen, I'm sorry I laughed at you that time you got diarrhea at Barnes and Noble. And I'm sorry I told everyone about it. And I'm sorry for repeating it now.
64614:
64615:Jessica Lopez: Laura, I don't hate you because you're fat. You're fat because I hate you.
64705:
64706:Crying Girl: I just wish we could all get along like we used to in middle school. I wish that I could bake a cake made out of rainbows and smiles, and we'd all eat it and be happy.
64887:
64888:Damian: She doesn't even go here!
64922:
64923:Ms. Norbury: Do you even go to this school?
64967:
64968:Crying Girl: No. I just have a lot of feelings.
65016:
65017:Ms. Norbury: OK, go home.
65043:
65098:
65099:Ms. Norbury: Thanks. I feel like I'm getting through.
65153:
65154:Gretchen: I'm sorry that people are so jealous of me. But I can't help it that I'm popular.
65246:
65247:Ms. Norbury: Oh, my God! Oh, jeez. OK, walk it off. Walk it off.
65312:
65313:Gretchen: OK. That hurt.
65338:
65339:Ms. Norbury: They're OK. They're OK. Oh, boy. OK, who's next? Who's next? Keep it going.
65428:
65429:Regina: Oh, my God. It's her dream come true, diving into a big pile of girls.
65508:
66299:
66300:Everyone: (cheering) Janis! Janis! Janis! Janis!
66349:
66412:
66413:Regina: To find out that everyone hates me? I don't care.
66471:
66508:
66509:Regina: No! Do you know what everyone says about you? They say that you're a home-schooled jungle freak, who's a less-hot version of me. Yeah. So don't try to act so innocent. You can take that fake apology and shove it right up your hairy...!
66753:
67018:
67019:Betsy: Everybody done?
67042:
67074:
67075:Betsy: I don't know what to believe anymore.
67120:
67163:
67164:Betsy: Why are my tribal vases under the sink?
67211:
67223:
67224:Betsy: My tribal vases. Why were they under the sink?
67278:
67299:
67300:Betsy: This is the fertility vase of the Ndebele tribe. Does that mean anything to you?
67388:
67399:
67400:Betsy: Who are you?
67420:
67483:
67484:Chip: Your mom does not hate you. She's afraid of you. I don't know, maybe we mainstream-schooled you too soon. Maybe you should come back and be home-schooled again for a while.
67663:
67731:
67732:Chip: How bad's it gonna be tomorrow?
67770:
67868:
67869:Chip: You're not a wart hog, you're a lion. Just focus on your studies for a little while. You're still an excellent student, right?
68002:
68056:
68057:Chip: Why?
68068:
68088:
68089:Chip: Hmm. OK. You are…What do they call it? Grounded. You're grounded.
68163:
68164:Students: “She pushed her in front of the bus”. “Did you see her do it”? “Yes”.
68256:
68337:
68338:Guy: No.
68347:
68348:Kevin: What are marijuana tablets?
68383:
68428:
68501:
68702:
68703:Aaron: That book was written by a bunch of stupid girls who make up rumors because they're bored with their own lame lives.
68827:
68969:
69031:
69062:
69090:
69426:
69427:Ms. Norbury: Oh, hi. Did you wanna buy some drugs?
69478:
69513:
69514:Ms. Norbury: Wait. I'll grade it right now. I gotta say, watching the police search my house really was the cherry on top of a fantastic year. How much trouble did you get in for telling the truth?
69712:
69726:
69824:
69921:
69922:Aaron: That's all right. Getting hit by a bus is pretty good punishment.
69995:
69996:Ms. Norbury: Ninety-four.
70022:
70023:Aaron: Welcome back, nerd.
70050:
70086:
70087:Ms. Norbury: I forgive you. But as my own personal form of punishment, I figured out how you're gonna earn that extra credit.
70213:
70313:
70314:Ms. Norbury: All right. It's all you.
70352:
70353:Kevin: OK.
70364:
70365:Ms. Norbury: Make me look good out there.
70407:
70408:Kevin: OK. Marymount, you sons of bitches. You no-good sons of bitches.
70480:
70481:Ms. Norbury: You nervous?
70507:
70519:
70520:Ms. Norbury: Don't be. You can do this. There's nothing to break your focus, because not one of those Marymount boys is cute.
70646:
70647:Presenter: Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. Welcome to the Illinois High School Mathletes State Championship. Let's start the competition. Here is the first question. Twice the larger of two numbers is three more than five times the smaller, and the sum of four times the larger and three times the smaller is 71. What are...? North Shore?
70990:
70991:Kevin: Fourteen and five.
71017:
71018:Presenter: That is correct. Question number two. Find an odd three-digit number whose digits add up to 12. The digits are all different, and the difference between the first two digits equals the difference between... Marymount?
71247:
71248:Marymount Captain: 741.
71272:
71273:Presenter: Correct.
71293:
71332:
71354:
71355:Chip: She went out.
71375:
71376:Betsy: She's grounded.
71399:
71400:Chip: Are they not allowed out when they're grounded?
71454:
71455:Damian: Don't forget to vote for Spring Fling King and Queen, people. These A-holes will represent you for a full calendar year.
71584:
71585:Guy: I'm gonna vote for Regina George because she got hit by that bus.
71656:
71737:
71738:Betsy: She's supposed to be grounded, but he let her out.
71796:
71797:Presenter: After 87 minutes of very competitive play, we have a tie. In the event of a tie, we move into a sudden-death round. Each team is given the opportunity to choose their opponent. North Shore, who do you select?
72017:
72018:Tim Pak: The girl, dude. The girl.
72053:
72054:Kevin: Contestant Krafft.
72080:
72081:Presenter: From Marymount, Miss Caroline Krafft.
72130:
72131:Marymount Captain: We pick the girl too.
72172:
72173:Presenter: And from North Shore, Miss Caddy Heron.
72224:
72265:
72578:
72579:Presenter: Contestants, find the limit of this equation.
72636:
72896:
72897:Caroline Krafft: The limit is negative one.
72941:
72971:
72972:Presenter: That answer is incorrect. Now, we are in a sudden death. If Miss Heron can answer this problem correctly, we have a winner.
73107:
73354:
73413:
73414:Presenter: Our new state champions, the North Shore Mathletes.
